# To be able to use Dyalog APL, you need to download 64-bit Dyalog APL Classic and Unicode
# to /opt This requires a valid Dyalog license. If you have one, you can save your MyDyalog
# username in this file and run the misc/dldyalogapl script manually, before the remaining
# setup scripts. If you do not have a license, you can run the setup script without the
# Dyalog APL archive, but Dyalog APL won't be installed.

# The following five settings are for the domain names used in the setup
# Please read more about them in accompanying documentation.

# Main TIO domain
# This is tio.run for original TIO
TIORUN=tio2.tryitonline.nz

# Secondary domain for redirecting
# This is tryitonline.net for original TIO
# Leave blank to skip setting up secondary domain
# TRYITONLINENET=www2.tryitonline.nz

# Domain for <language>.tryitonline.net -> tio.run/nexus/<language> redirects.
# This setting is optional and may be left empty or removed entirely.

# This is your email used for LetsEncrypt certificate revocations
EMAIL=letsencrypt@tryitonline.nz

# Put your backed up let's encrypt certificates from previous TIO installation in
# private/letsencrypt.tar.gz and leave this setting alone
# Alternatively if you do not have the certs yet and would like to generate them
# change the line to
# UseSavedCerts="n"
# Note that LetsEncrypt limits you to 5 cert requests per week so you do not want
# to keep this setting saying n if your first attempt to install the mirror failed
# see accompanying documentation to find out how to back up generated letsencrypt
# certificates in this case
UseSavedCerts="y"

# You can provide your own SSH key pairs or let them be generated automatically.
# For the root (resp. apache) user, if either an RSA key pair (id_rsa and id_rsa.pub)
# or an ED25519 key pair (id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub) is found in private/root
# (resp. private/apache), they will be copied in the user's ssh folder. Otherwise, an
# ED25519 key pair will be generated automatically.
# Likewise, if either an RSA key pair (ssh_host_rsa and ssh_host_rsa.pub) or an
# ED25519 key pair (ssh_host_ed25519 and ssh_host_ed25519.pub) is found in private,
# they will replace the pre-generated host keys in /etc/ssh.

# This option should be left turned off ("n"). If it's turned on ("y") certificates
# and selinux configuration will be skipped during setup. This is useful for running
# an offline copy of TryItOnline in a docker image (which does no support selinux)
# Exposing an installation in offline mode to internet is a big security risk and should 
# never be done.
